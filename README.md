# Horiseon-Search-Optimization

  For this project I cleaned up the HTML code and changed the elements to use semantic HTML elements.In the css file for this I fixed the navigation buttons so they would take you to the correct location on the page. I also reordered the to line up with the flow of the HTML file. Then in general just cleaned uo the code to make it easier to read.
